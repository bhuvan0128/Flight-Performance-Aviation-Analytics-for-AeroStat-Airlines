# Flight-Performance-Aviation-Analytics-for-AeroStat-Airlines

## Overview

This project analyzes airline performance and operational efficiency using MySQL, Power BI, and DAX. The goal is to identify key factors affecting flight punctuality, cancellations, and route efficiency. By leveraging SQL for data extraction and Power BI for visualization, we provide actionable insights for optimizing airline operations.

**Key Features**

## SQL Queries

- Flight delay analysis (average departure & arrival delays)

- Most frequent flight routes

- Airline performance ranking (on-time performance)

- Flight cancellation trends & reasons

- Airport congestion & busiest routes

- Weather-related disruptions

- Seasonal trends in air traffic

- Passenger connectivity & hub efficiency


## Power BI Dashboard

- Flight Operations Overview: Analyzing operational efficiency and punctuality

- Airline Performance Comparison: Benchmarking airline efficiency

- Route & Airport Analytics: Identifying high-traffic airports & routes

- Flight Cancellation & Delay Patterns: Understanding disruptions

- Passenger Experience & Service Quality: Evaluating service impact

- Financial & Operational Efficiency: Assessing cost-per-mile & revenue losses



**Data & Methodology**

- SQL: Extracting insights from flight operations data

- Power BI: Creating interactive dashboards for executive decision-making

- DAX: Advanced calculations for key performance metrics


## Insights & Recommendations

- Some airlines excel in on-time performance, while others face significant delays

- Certain routes and airports contribute to congestion and inefficiency

- Flight cancellations are largely driven by weather, technical issues, and congestion

- Airlines can enhance profitability by improving scheduling and reducing delays


## Technologies Used

- MySQL for data analysis

- Power BI for dashboard visualization

- DAX for advanced calculations


## Exicutive Summery

The Flight Performance & Aviation Analytics for AeroStat Airlines project leverages SQL, Power BI, and machine learning to analyze airline performance and operational efficiency. The study focuses on key challenges such as flight delays, cancellations, congestion, and financial inefficiencies. SQL queries are used to analyze factors like average departure and arrival delays, most popular flight routes, on-time performance rankings, cancellation trends, airport congestion, weather disruptions, seasonal air traffic patterns, and hub efficiency.

The Power BI dashboard is structured into six key sections:

1. Flight Operations Overview – Examines flight activity trends, delays, and punctuality to optimize scheduling.


2. Airline Performance Comparison – Identifies operational strengths and weaknesses by benchmarking airlines.


3. Route & Airport Analytics – Highlights congestion issues and busiest airports for better resource allocation.


4. Flight Cancellation & Delay Patterns – Analyzes causes of disruptions, including weather and technical issues.


5. Passenger Experience & Service Quality – Evaluates delay recovery, missed connections, and overall service efficiency.


6. Financial & Operational Efficiency – Assesses fuel efficiency, cost per mile, and revenue losses due to disruptions.



Key findings indicate that while some airlines excel in punctuality, others struggle with delays and congestion. Flight cancellations and delays, influenced by weather and technical problems, lead to financial losses amounting to $24.92 billion. Despite a high customer satisfaction score of 96.91%, missed connections and delay recovery remain areas for improvement. To address these challenges, airlines are advised to focus on AI-driven analytics, proactive scheduling, cost reduction, and improved passenger communication to enhance performance and long-term profitability.
